## What It Is

A QR (Quick Response) code is a two-dimensional barcode that can store various types of data, including text. When text is encoded into a QR code, it becomes a scannable representation of that textual information.

## Common Use Cases

- **URLs & Website Links**: Directing users to web pages without typing long URLs
- **Contact Information**: Storing names, phone numbers, and email addresses
- **WiFi Credentials**: Quick connection to networks by scanning instead of manual entry
- **Event Details**: Conference information, dates, times, and locations
- **Product Information**: Descriptions, warnings, or instructions on packaging
- **Social Media Profiles**: Direct links to social accounts
- **Authentication**: Two-factor authentication codes and verification tokens
